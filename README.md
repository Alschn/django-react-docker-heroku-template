This repository serves as a starting point for developing a 
production-ready application using Django Rest Framework, 
React with Typescript and Postgres in a Dockerized environment 
with an option to deploy to Heroku. 

### Tools, libraries, frameworks:
This setup has been tested with Python 3.8/3.9 and Node 12.

#### Backend
- Django + Django Rest Framework
- `django-cors-headers` - handling cross origin requests
- `coverage` - for code coverage reports and running unit tests
- `mypy` + `djangorestframework-stubs` - for better typing experience
- `psycopg2` - needed to use Postgres (in Docker container)
- `gunicorn` - production wsgi http server
- `whitenoise` - building static files

Suggested packages: 
- `drf-yasg` - open api documentation (swagger and redoc) 
- `django-rest-auth`, `django-allauth` - making auth easier

#### Frontend
- React
- Typescript
- `node-sass` - enables scss/sass support
- `axios` - for making requests

Suggested packages: 
- `@material-ui/core`, `@material-ui/lab`, `@material-ui/icons` - UI library

# Development setup

## Without Docker
### Backend
Create a virtual environment from cmd (or do it in Pycharm manually)
```shell script
cd backend

py -3 -m venv venv

venv/Scripts/Activate

python -m pip install --upgrade pip

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run django application from cmd (or add new Django configuration if using Pycharm)
```shell script
python manage.py runserver
```

Preparing (if there are any changes to db schema) and running migrations
```shell script
python manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate
```

Create superuser
```shell script
python manage.py createsuper user
```

### Frontend
Install node dependencies.
```shell script
cd frontend

npm i
```
Run development server in second terminal
```shell script
npm start
```

### Backend tests coverage
```shell script
cd backend
```
Run tests using Coverage instead of `python manage.py test`
```shell script
coverage run manage.py test
```
Get report from coverage:
```shell script
coverage report -m
```

## With Docker
Make sure Docker Engine is running.  

While in **root directory**, build docker images and run them with docker-compose. This might take up to few minutes.

```shell script
docker-compose up --build
```

Application should be up and running at `127.0.0.1` (by default)  

If images had been installed and **no changes have been made**, just run to start containers:
```shell script
docker-compose up
```

Bringing down containers with **optional** -v flag removes **all** attached volumes and invalidates caches.
```shell script
docker-compose down
```

To run commands in active container:
```shell script
docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID bash
```


# Production Deployment  
   1) [Create Heroku Account](https://signup.heroku.com/dc)  
   2) [Download/Install/Setup Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install)  
    - After install, log into Heroku CLI: `heroku login`  
   3) Run: `heroku create <your app name>` to create the Heroku application    
   4) Add git remote ```heroku git:remote -a <your app name>```
   4) Set your environment variables for your production environment by running:  
    ```
    heroku config:set PRODUCTION_HOST=<your app name>.herokuapp.com SECRET_KEY=<your secret key> DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.prod
    ```  
   5) Run: `heroku stack:set container` so Heroku knows this is a containerized application  
   6) Run: `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev` which creates the postgres add-on for Heroku 
   7) Deploy your app by running: `git push heroku master`,  
   *or* by pushing to your github repository,  
   *or* manually in Heroku dashboard  
   8) Go to `<your app name>.herokuapp.com` to see the published website.  


## CI/CD
This repository uses Github Actions to run test and deploy pipelines.
`backend.yml` - runs django unit tests with postgres container  
`frontend.yml` - runs react unit tests
`deploy.yml` - automatic deploy to Heroku after the workflows above have passed.
Delete this file or adjust branches on which it runs, if you don't want automatic deploy.

If you want to use Automatic Deploy to Heroku:
1) Set HEROKU_API_KEY, HEROKU_EMAIL, HEROKU_APP_NAME secrets in repository settings
2) Push to master (or branch of your choice)
